// Temporary script I used to migrate to lexical. Not used anymore after it was migrated but
// can be useful for learning so I saved it here.
//
// This is a 5-step migration:
// 1. Backup the database.
// 2. Make sure all `type: 'richText` fields are using `editor: lexicalEditor(...)`. See resources for this.
// 3. Ran the app to check if there are any issues. If there are, manually resolve them, I noticed there were a bunch so I just listed down each id.
// 4. Lastly, when done, you can simply run this migration script and it will migrate them.
// 5. Make sure to check each data again, there were a couple for me. Then clean them so it complies to the schema (this is just trial and error like making sure "content": null, etc).
